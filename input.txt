How to use?
1
The first thing you'll need to do is open the espionage preview report of the player you want to load.

In the report you will see the `API` button at the bottom left of the report, hover it to show the key.

Select the key completely and copy it (hint: use the shortcut Ctrl+c).

2
When you're at the homepage of TrashSim you need to paste the `API` key into the textfield of the defender or another player.

Now that you've pasted the key press the `load espionage report`. This will load all the needed information into the correct fields, even the server settings.

Afterwards you need to enter your own fleet data before you can start the simulation.

3
When everything is ready you can press the `Simulate` button at the bottom or in the top right corner.

A loading screen will open where you can track the simulation proces.

The result will appear below the bottom simulate button. It contains a number of tables which will give you an indication on what the battle result could be.

Options
 Enable multiple workers for running simulations, this will result in faster simulations.
The amount of workers that'll be used for running the simulations. The best amount would be the number of cores on your computer. (Empty or 0 means that the number of workers will be calculated automatically)
